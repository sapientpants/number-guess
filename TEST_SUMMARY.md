## Key Test Findings

All critical game logic is properly tested:
1. **Games Played vs Games Won**: Correctly tracks started games separately from completed games
2. **Average Calculation**: Only considers guesses from won games
3. **Win Rate**: Properly accounts for abandoned games
4. **Input Validation**: Filters non-digit characters and validates range
5. **Game State**: Properly transitions between idle, playing, and won states
